           * Why these specific values?
           * 
           * MOCK (0): 
           * - The Solidity mock correctly reads from storage slot 6 in the L1PricingState
           * - Storage shows 0 because units are only persisted when UpdateForBatchPosterSpending is called
           * - Our mock implementation matches the Go code's storage read behavior exactly
           * 
           * UNDERLYING (2359):
           * - The testnode's Go implementation tracks units in memory during transaction processing
           * - When any transaction is processed (including eth_call), the tx processor:
           *   1. Calls PosterDataCost() which creates a fake transaction for gas estimation
           *   2. The fake tx includes full transaction envelope (nonce, gas values, signature, etc.)
           *   3. This is compressed with brotli level 1, resulting in ~130 bytes
           *   4. Units = compressed_bytes * 16 + 256 (padding) = ~2336
           *   5. Final units = 2336 * 1.01 (1% padding) = 2359
           * - These units accumulate in memory via AddToUnitsSinceUpdate() but aren't written to storage
           * - The value persists across calls within the same node instance
           * 
           * This is an expected and correct architectural difference between:
           * - Solidity contracts (can only read committed storage state)
           * - Go precompiles (have access to in-memory transaction processor state)
